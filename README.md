# Tandemloop_2nd-round_Assessment
Hi, I completed my 2nd round assessment. I did the assessment for desktop screen. 
Keeping the existing https://zone.tandemloop.net/ website, I did some research, competative analysis and I redesigned for user friendly actions.
There was no back button or home button or page after entring into next step. So i gave an option of it along with other features. Here is the Figma link for the same.
